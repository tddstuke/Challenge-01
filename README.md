# Making Code More Accessible

This repository was an exercise in refractoring code and making it more accessible. I began by going throught the HTML and removing any `<div>`
tags that could be replaced with semantic HTML ie. `<header>`  `<section>` and `<article>` tags.

I refractored the CSS code by making it less cluttered and combining any classes or ids that could be merged. I restructured the CSS so that it mirrored the HTML flow.

I provided `alt` descriptions for all relative images for screen readers

I made sure all `h` elements fall into sequential order
